## Why I found this article interesting?
This articles dives into the pressing question on whehter or not Artificial Intelligence (AI) will replace the roles of software engineers. This was the primary reason as to why found this article interesting as this is a common debate amongst professionals within the field. The article starts off by highlighting the skills of AI, such as automating repetitive tasks, smarter bug detection and testing, and transforming the DevOps process. And it concludes by claiming that human touch and behavior are aspects that are irreplaceable by AI. Humans can brainstorm and produce creative and unique thoughts, unlike AI who relies and references its data to deliver its results. AI lacks the ability to properly integrate into a team where collaboration, communication, and understanding nuanced human emotions are key players in determining success. Furthermore, humans can continuosly learn, while AI requires updates and reprogramming prompting a dependency to humans.

I was really interested in this article because this was also something that has been on my mind since software engineering was a role that I intended to take on. I was worried that AI may end up replacing our positions making our effort worthless. After reading this article I am much more satisfied to learn that humans will still be a necessary component in properly delivering a software engineering project.
